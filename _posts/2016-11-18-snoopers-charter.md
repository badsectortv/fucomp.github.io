# The Snoopers Charter

> The UK Government ratifies law to allow unprecedented access to dizzying amounts of data to intelligence agencies

![They definitely are watching you](http://i.giphy.com/Kwz3IWpFJJ064.gif)

## What is the Snoopers Charter?

The very Britishly named Snoopers Charter is a broad ranging and vaguely worded ~~set of rules~~ law that allows the Government and any of its security and intelligence agencies (their terms, not mine) access to a UK citizen's phone or computer with a warrant. Rather more worrying is the "Bulk Surveillance" option that they may opt for. They currently can't sweep that particular broad beam onto a private British citizen but they can train it on groups who they determine to be a risk to the UK, again via a warrant. The reason that this causes me concern is that although it's illegal for them to snoop on me personally unless I become a visible threat to the nation and its security, it doesn't preclude them from trading with other nations with broad ranging powers like the US' NSA for that data anyway.

Paranoid? Perhaps but with good reason, this has happened [before](http://www.theweek.co.uk/uk-news/62437/gchq-unlawfully-spied-on-uk-citizens-through-nsa).

There's no guarantee that what you're doing now might not be illegal in the future and retroactively acted upon or that something you wish to remain a secret, for whatever reason - maybe you like dressing up as a member of the Royal Family and sticking carrots up your arse, that that information could be held against you for purposes of coercion later. In the words of my better half it is time to "Encrypt Yo' Shit". For realsies this time.

## Will it change anything?

Well apart from the violation of the individual's right to privacy as [outlined](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/privacy) in the Human Rights Act you are potentially never alone with your thoughts or the ability to express them digitally without it being traced back to you. You'll never shop, text, tweet, email, write a text note, spend a digital penny without Big Brother jotting it down and weighing your actions as a potential threat to its existence. I say that knowledge of the constant vivisection changes a lot. A surveilled society is an obedient society I presume.

## What should you take away from this?

* Always read the small print. I know we never do, nobody ever does. Start.
* If you don't like the connotations, learn to say no and find an [alternative](https://alternativeto.net/).
* Use a VPN. Not just at home but also on your mobile devices. I recommend [NordVPN](https://www.nordvpn.com/).
* Install [Pi-Hole](https://www.pi-hole.net/) on your home network and stop tracking and ads. Keep it updated.
* Start using Signal by Whisper Systems. Tell all your friends and family, help them if they need to set it up.
* If you like group chat consider switching from Slack to Semaphore.
* Consider voting for your local [Pirate Party](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/) or pro-privacy candidate
