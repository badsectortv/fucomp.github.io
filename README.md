# FU!comp

## Getting started

In theory:
```bash
make dev-env
```
should get you set up and
```bash
make serve
```
should give you a local instance which will update as you change files

## Submission Guidelines - Provisional

Fork the repository and check out a working branch with a name based on your
submission. Note that we will outright reject any pull requests from your master
branch as we want to review each submission individually.

Commit any articles, stories, posts etc to the `/_posts` folder of your fork.
When you are happy with your content submit a pull request and it will be
reviewed by a member of staff. Any comments and corrections will be available to
view in the PR process.  On successful submission your PR will be merged into
the master branch, so make sure it's ready before you PR! Congratulations!

Note that fucomp members ALSO have to go through the PR process to ensure a
consistent standard applied to all editorial.
