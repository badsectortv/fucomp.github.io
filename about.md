Fuck You Computer (fuckyou.computer, fu:c, fu!comp or whatever you want to call
it) is a (very) loosely organised anarchistic collective based around
computing, how it is and how it should be.

Working on the philosophy that your computer should do what it's fucking told,
not what it thinks you should probably want, we're all about chopping out the
bloat and replacing it with bile, vitriol and text-based interfaces.
